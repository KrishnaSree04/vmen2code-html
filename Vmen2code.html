                                      remarkable in many ways, not only did she create a very complex program for
                                      finding ”Bernoulli’s number” (a commonly occuring sequence of numbers in

                                      She is one of the world’s most accomplished computer scientists, as she was

                                      of the team at Harvard that built the

                                      commercial computer and also invented the programming language COBOL, which
                                      is
                                      still in use. In fact,she came up with the idea of using compilations

                                      NACA (now NASA) where
                                      she, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson analyzed data from plane crashes.

                                      system that was used by the Allies for winning the war. Her communication

                                      allowed for tracking missiles under water without them being detected. She
                                      patented this technology
                                      but despite that was never compensated for the military’s use of it. Her
                                      technology also later became
                                      the basis for technologies such as WiFi, GPS and bluetooth. </p>
